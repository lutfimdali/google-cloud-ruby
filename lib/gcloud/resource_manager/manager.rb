      # Retrieves the projects that are visible to the user and satisfy the
      # specified filter. This method returns projects in an unspecified order.
      # New projects do not necessarily appear at the end of the list.
      #
      # @param [String] filter An expression for filtering the results of the
      #   request. Filter rules are case insensitive.
      #
      #   The fields eligible for filtering are:
      #
      #   * `name`
      #   * `id`
      #   * `labels.key` - where `key` is the name of a label
      #
      #   Some examples of using labels as filters:
      #
      #   * `name:*` - The project has a name.
      #   * `name:Howl` - The project's name is Howl or howl.
      #   * `name:HOWL` - Equivalent to above.
      #   * `NAME:howl` - Equivalent to above.
      #   * `labels.color:*` - The project has the label color.
      #   * `labels.color:red` - The project's label color has the value red.
      #   * <code>labels.color:red labels.size:big</code> - The project's label
      #     color has the value red and its label size has the value big.
      # @param [String] token A previously-returned page token representing part
      #   of the larger set of results to view.
      # @param [Integer] max Maximum number of projects to return.
      #
      # @return [Array<Gcloud::ResourceManager::Project>] (See
      #   {Gcloud::ResourceManager::Project::List})
