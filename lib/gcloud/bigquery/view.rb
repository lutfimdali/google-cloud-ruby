    # # View
    #
    # A view is a virtual table defined by a SQL query. You can query views in
    # the browser tool, or by using a query job.
    #
    # BigQuery's views are logical views, not materialized views, which means
    # that the query that defines the view is re-executed every time the view is
    # queried. Queries are billed according to the total amount of data in all
    # table fields referenced directly or indirectly by the top-level query.
    #
    # @example
    #   require "gcloud"
    #
    #   gcloud = Gcloud.new
    #   bigquery = gcloud.bigquery
    #   dataset = bigquery.dataset "my_dataset"
    #   view = dataset.create_view "my_view",
    #            "SELECT name, age FROM [proj:dataset.users]"

      #   page of results. Setting this flag to a small value such as 1000 and
      #   then paging through results might improve reliability when the query
      #   result set is large. In addition to this limit, responses are also
      #   limited to 10 MB. By default, there is no maximum row count, and only
      #   the byte limit applies.
      # @param [Integer] timeout How long to wait for the query to complete, in
      #   milliseconds, before the request times out and returns. Note that this
      #   is only a timeout for the request, not the query. If the query takes
      #   longer to run than the timeout value, the call returns without any
      #   results and with QueryData#complete? set to false. The default value
      #   is 10000 milliseconds (10 seconds).
      # @param [Boolean] cache Whether to look for the result in the query
      #   cache. The query cache is a best-effort cache that will be flushed
      #   whenever tables in the query are modified. The default value is true.
      #   For more information, see [query
      #   caching](https://developers.google.com/bigquery/querying-data).
      # @param [Boolean] dryrun If set to `true`, BigQuery doesn't run the job.
      #   Instead, if the query is valid, BigQuery returns statistics about the
      #   job such as how many bytes would be processed. If the query is
