{"id":"google/cloud/trace/middleware","name":"Middleware","title":["Google","Cloud","Trace","Middleware"],"description":"<h1 id=\"trace-middleware\">Trace Middleware</h1>\n\n<p>A Rack middleware that manages trace context and captures a trace of\nthe request. Specifically, it:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li>Reads the trace context from the request headers, if present.\nOtherwise, generates a new trace context.</li>\n  <li>Makes a sampling decision if one is not already specified.</li>\n  <li>Records a span measuring the entire handling of the request,\nannotated with a set of standard request data.</li>\n  <li>Makes the trace context available so downstream middlewares and the\napp can add further spans to the trace.</li>\n  <li>Sends the completed trace to the Stackdriver service.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"installing\">Installing</h2>\n\n<p>To use this middleware, simply install it in your middleware stack.\nHere is an example Sinatra application that includes the Trace\nmiddleware:</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\"># Simple sinatra application\n\nrequire \"sinatra\"\nrequire \"google/cloud/trace\"\n\nuse Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware\n\nget \"/\" do\n  \"Hello World!\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>Here is an example <code>config.ru</code> file for a web application that uses\nthe standard Rack configuration mechanism.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\"># config.ru for simple Rack application\n\nrequire \"google/cloud/trace\"\nuse Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware\n\nrun MyApp\n</code></pre>\n\n<p>If your application uses Ruby On Rails, you may also use the provided\n<a data-custom-type=\"google/cloud/trace/railtie\">Google::Cloud::Trace::Railtie</a> for close integration with Rails and\nActiveRecord.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"custom-measurements\">Custom measurements</h2>\n\n<p>By default, this middleware creates traces that measure just the http\nrequest handling as a whole. If you want to provide more detailed\nmeasurements of smaller processes, use the classes provided in this\nlibrary. Below is a Sinatra example to get you started.</p>\n\n<pre><code class=\"language-ruby\"># Simple sinatra application\n\nrequire \"sinatra\"\nrequire \"google/cloud/trace\"\n\nuse Google::Cloud::Trace::Middleware\n\nget \"/\" do\n  Google::Cloud::Trace.in_span \"Sleeping on the job!\" do\n    sleep rand\n  end\n  \"Hello World!\"\nend\n</code></pre>\n\n<h2 id=\"sampling-and-blacklisting\">Sampling and blacklisting</h2>\n\n<p>A sampler makes the decision whether to record a trace for each\nrequest (if the decision was not made by the context, e.g. by providing\na request header). By default, this sampler is the default\n<a data-custom-type=\"google/cloud/trace/timesampler\">Google::Cloud::Trace::TimeSampler</a>, which enforces a maximum QPS per\nprocess, and blacklists a small number of request paths such as\nhealth checks sent by Google App Engine. You may adjust this behavior\nby providing an alternate sampler.
