{"id":"google/cloud/trace/timesampler","name":"TimeSampler","title":["Google","Cloud","Trace","TimeSampler"],"description":"<p>A sampler determines whether a given requestâ€™s latency trace should\nactually be reported. It is usually not necessary to trace every\nrequest, especially for an application serving heavy traffic. You may\nuse a sampler to decide, for a given request, whether to report its\ntrace. A sampler is simply a Proc that takes the Rack environment as an\nargument and returns a boolean indicating whether or not to sample the\ncurrent request. Alternately, it could be an object that duck-types the\nProc interface by implementing the <code>call</code> method.</p>\n\n<p>TimeSampler is the default sampler. It bases its sampling decision on\ntwo considerations:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>It allows you to blacklist certain URI paths that should never be\ntraced. For example, the Google App Engine health check request\npath <code>/_ah/health</code> is blacklisted by default.</li>\n  <li>It spaces samples out by delaying a minimum time between each\nsample. This enforces a maximum QPS for this Ruby process.</li>\n</ol>","source":"google-cloud-trace/lib/google/cloud/trace/time_sampler.rb#L37","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"initialize-constructor","type":"constructor","name":"initialize","title":["Google","Cloud","Trace","TimeSampler#initialize"],"description":"<p>Create a TimeSampler for the given QPS.</p>","source":"google-cloud-trace/lib/google/cloud/trace/time_sampler.rb#L51","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[{"name":"qps","types":["Number"],"description":"Samples per second.
