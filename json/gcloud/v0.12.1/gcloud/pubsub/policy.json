{"id":"gcloud/pubsub/policy","name":"Policy","title":["Gcloud","Pubsub","Policy"],"description":"<h1 id=\"policy\">Policy</h1>\n\n<p>Represents a Cloud IAM Policy for the Pub/Sub service.</p>\n\n<p>A common pattern for updating a resourceâ€™s metadata, such as its Policy,\nis to read the current data from the service, update the data locally, and\nthen send the modified data for writing. This pattern may result in a\nconflict if two or more processes attempt the sequence simultaneously. IAM\nsolves this problem with the <a data-custom-type=\"gcloud/pubsub/policy\" data-method=\"etag-instance\">Gcloud::Pubsub::Policy#etag</a> property, which\nis used to verify whether the policy has changed since the last request.\nWhen you make a request to with an <code>etag</code> value, Cloud IAM compares the\n<code>etag</code> value in the request with the existing <code>etag</code> value associated with\nthe policy. It writes the policy only if the <code>etag</code> values match.</p>\n\n<p>When you update a policy, first read the policy (and its current <code>etag</code>)\nfrom the service, then modify the policy locally, and then write the\nmodified policy to the service.
