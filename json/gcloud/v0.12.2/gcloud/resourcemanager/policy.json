{"id":"gcloud/resourcemanager/policy","name":"Policy","title":["Gcloud","ResourceManager","Policy"],"description":"<h1 id=\"policy\">Policy</h1>\n\n<p>Represents a Cloud IAM Policy for the Resource Manager service.</p>\n\n<p>A common pattern for updating a resourceâ€™s metadata, such as its Policy,\nis to read the current data from the service, update the data locally, and\nthen send the modified data for writing. This pattern may result in a\nconflict if two or more processes attempt the sequence simultaneously. IAM\nsolves this problem with the <a data-custom-type=\"gcloud/resourcemanager/policy\" data-method=\"etag-instance\">Gcloud::ResourceManager::Policy#etag</a>\nproperty, which is used to verify whether the policy has changed since the\nlast request. When you make a request to with an <code>etag</code> value, Cloud IAM\ncompares the <code>etag</code> value in the request with the existing <code>etag</code> value\nassociated with the policy. It writes the policy only if the <code>etag</code> values\nmatch.</p>\n\n<p>When you update a policy, first read the policy (and its current <code>etag</code>)\nfrom the service, then modify the policy locally, and then write the\nmodified policy to the service.
