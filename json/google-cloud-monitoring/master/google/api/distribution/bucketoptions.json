The histogram is given in +bucket_counts+ as counts of values\nthat fall into one of a sequence of non-overlapping buckets.  The sequence\nof buckets is described by +bucket_options+.</p>\n\n<p>A bucket specifies an inclusive lower bound and exclusive upper bound for\nthe values that are counted for that bucket.  The upper bound of a bucket\nis strictly greater than the lower bound.</p>\n\n<p>The sequence of N buckets for a Distribution consists of an underflow\nbucket (number 0), zero or more finite buckets (number 1 through N - 2) and\nan overflow bucket (number N - 1).  The buckets are contiguous:  the lower\nbound of bucket i (i &gt; 0) is the same as the upper bound of bucket i - 1.\nThe buckets span the whole range of finite values: lower bound of the\nunderflow bucket is -infinity and the upper bound of the overflow bucket is\n+infinity.  The finite buckets are so-called because both bounds are\nfinite.</p>\n\n<p>+BucketOptions+ describes bucket boundaries in one of three ways.  Two\ndescribe the boundaries by giving parameters for a formula to generate\nboundaries and one gives the bucket boundaries explicitly.</p>\n\n<p>If +bucket_boundaries+ is not given, then no +bucket_counts+ may be given.</p>","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"methods":[{"id":"linear_buckets-instance","type":"instance","name":"linear_buckets","title":["Google","Api","Distribution","BucketOptions#linear_buckets"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/api/distribution/bucketoptions/linear\">Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions::Linear</a>"],"description":"The linear bucket."}]},{"id":"linear_buckets=-instance","type":"instance","name":"linear_buckets=","title":["Google","Api","Distribution","BucketOptions#linear_buckets="],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/api/distribution/bucketoptions/linear\">Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions::Linear</a>"],"description":"The linear bucket."}]},{"id":"exponential_buckets-instance","type":"instance","name":"exponential_buckets","title":["Google","Api","Distribution","BucketOptions#exponential_buckets"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/api/distribution/bucketoptions/exponential\">Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions::Exponential</a>"],"description":"The exponential buckets."}]},{"id":"exponential_buckets=-instance","type":"instance","name":"exponential_buckets=","title":["Google","Api","Distribution","BucketOptions#exponential_buckets="],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/api/distribution/bucketoptions/exponential\">Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions::Exponential</a>"],"description":"The exponential buckets."}]},{"id":"explicit_buckets-instance","type":"instance","name":"explicit_buckets","title":["Google","Api","Distribution","BucketOptions#explicit_buckets"],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/api/distribution/bucketoptions/explicit\">Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions::Explicit</a>"],"description":"The explicit buckets."}]},{"id":"explicit_buckets=-instance","type":"instance","name":"explicit_buckets=","title":["Google","Api","Distribution","BucketOptions#explicit_buckets="],"description":"","source":"google-cloud-monitoring/lib/google/cloud/monitoring/v3/doc/google/api/distribution.rb#L113","resources":[],"examples":[],"params":[],"exceptions":[],"returns":[{"types":["<a data-custom-type=\"google/api/distribution/bucketoptions/explicit\">Google::Api::Distribution::BucketOptions::Explicit</a>"],"description":"The explicit buckets."}]}]}
